## Design

### Website design

Our website's design has been designed with user-friendliness and accessibility in mind, as per the requierments to adhere to the **WCAG 2.1 (AA)** guidlines, for the school project. We have incorporated several key design elements to ensure that our webiste is an inclusive and user-friendly platform for everyone:


- **High Contrast Backgrounds:** We utilize high contrast backgrounds to effectively separate text from the background, enhancing readability and making content more accessible. we also use only one background color, but with different light levels to avoid the risk of a bad color selaction on the website. that also helps for implementing dark an lite mode.

- **Readable Text:** We have chosen relatively large text sizes and generous line spacing to improve text readability. These design choices are especially beneficial for individuals with dyslexia and ensure that our content is easily digestible.

- **Keyboard Navigation:** Our website is designed with keyboard navigation in mind. Users can easily navigate through the site and access all features without relying on a mouse. This feature is essential for individuals who rely on assistive technologies or prefer keyboard-based navigation.

- **Alternative Texts:** We provide alternative texts **(alt text)** for all non-text elements, such as images and icons. This ensures that users with visual impairments or those using screen readers can understand the context and content of these elements.

- **Responsive Design:** Our webiste is responsive, meaning it can be comfortably viewed on screens of various sizes, from smartphones to large TV screens. This responsive design ensures a consistent and user-friendly experience across all devices.

By implementing these design principles, we adhere to the guidelines of **WCAG 2.1 (AA)**, which prioritize creating accessible and user-friendly interfaces on the web. Our commitment to accessibility ensures that our webiste is a welcoming and inclusive platform for all users.

### Code Readability

We prioritize code readability to enhance understanding and maintainability. Here's how we achieve this:

- **Meaningful Variables:** We use descriptive variable names.
- **Comments:** Our code is well-commented to explain logic (mostly in JavaScript)
- **Semantic HTML:** We employ semantic class names and IDs.
- **Organized Structure:** Our project follows a clear folder structure: Pages, Layouts, JS, CSS, and Assets.
- **Consistency:** We maintain a consistent coding style for clarity.

These practices make our code more accessible and collaborative, supporting our project's growth and maintenance.

### Accessibility Testing

- **Alt Text Verification:** We confirmed the functionality of alt texts using a text-to-speech tool.
- **Color Accessibility:** We assessed color contrast for color blindness and grayscale using [Adobe Contrast Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/sv/create/color-contrast-analyzer), AA contrast, and AAA standards.
- **Dyslexia Readability:** To ensure readability, we tested our code with a dyslexia simulator, considering team member Sebastian's dyslexia.
- **Functional Variation Simulation:** We used the Funkify Chrome extension to simulate various disabilities and functional variations.
  - [Funkify Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/funkify-%E2%80%93-disability-simu/ojcijjdchelkddboickefhnbdpeajdjg)
- **Automated Evaluation:** Our website underwent automated evaluation using the Wave Evaluation Tool, checking for alt text and usability errors.
